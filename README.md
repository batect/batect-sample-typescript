# batect-sample-typescript

![Pipeline](https://github.com/batect/batect-sample-typescript/workflows/Pipeline/badge.svg?branch=master)

A sample application with [batect](https://github.com/batect/batect)-based build and testing environments.

Run `./batect --list-tasks` to see the available tasks and their descriptions, then `./batect <task>` to run `<task>`.

## Notes

This is just a sample application used to demonstrate how to use batect - it is certainly not an example of good practices or
production-ready TypeScript.
